    "Abstract": "Understanding the multispectral dynamics of subterranean microbial communities is crucial for microbial ecosystem mapping. This extensive multispectral exploration includes spectral signatures and metagenomic profiles of 100,000 microbial colonies from underground habitats exposed to various environmental conditions. We reveal unique spectral responses and identify genetic elements linked to microbial functions in the subterranean ecosystem. Notably, we observe dynamic changes in microbial spectra and functional pathways in response to underground environmental variations. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for deciphering the complex interactions within subterranean microbial communities.",

At the 3p21.31 COVID-19 risk locus, a candidate variant overlapped a distal cCRE linked to SLC6A20, a gene expressed in alveolar cells and with known functional association with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2.

    "Abstract": "Respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 has placed focus on the lungs. Here, we present single-nucleus accessible chromatin profiles of 90,980 nuclei and matched single-nucleus transcriptomes of 46,500 nuclei in non-diseased lungs from donors of ~30 weeks gestation,~3 years and ~30 years. We mapped candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and linked them to putative target genes. We identified distal cCREs with age-increased activity linked to SARS-CoV-2 host entry gene TMPRSS2 in alveolar type 2 cells, which had immune regulatory signatures and harbored variants associated with respiratory traits. At the 3p21.31 COVID-19 risk locus, a candidate variant overlapped a distal cCRE linked to SLC6A20, a gene expressed in alveolar cells and with known functional association with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Our findings provide insight into regulatory logic underlying genes implicated in COVID-19 in individual lung cell types across age. More broadly, these datasets will facilitate interpretation of risk loci for lung diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding the multispectral dynamics of subterranean microbial communities is crucial for microbial ecosystem mapping. This extensive multispectral exploration includes spectral signatures and metagenomic profiles of 100,000 microbial colonies from underground habitats exposed to various environmental conditions. We reveal unique spectral responses and identify genetic elements linked to microbial functions in the subterranean ecosystem. Notably, we observe dynamic changes in microbial spectra and functional pathways in response to underground environmental variations. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for deciphering the complex interactions within subterranean microbial communities.",
