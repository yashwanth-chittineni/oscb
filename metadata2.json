    "Abstract": "Understanding cardiac cell-type-specific responses to physiological stress in the human heart is vital for cardiovascular health. This integrated single-cell analysis includes transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility profiles of 160,000 heart cells from donors across various age groups. We reveal unique cardiac cell-type-specific reactions and identify regulatory elements linked to genes implicated in response to physiological stress. Notably, we observe dynamic changes in cell states and functional pathways in response to physiological stress. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying heart responses to physiological stress.",
