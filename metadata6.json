Here, we present single-nucleus accessible chromatin profiles of 100,000 nuclei and matched single-nucleus transcriptomes of 50,000 nuclei in non-diseased hearts from donors of varying ages. We mapped candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and linked them to putative target genes. We identified distal cCREs with age-increased activity linked to cardiac genes associated with heart failure. At key cardiac risk loci, candidate variants overlapped distal cCREs linked to genes with known functional associations with cardiovascular health. Our findings provide insight into the regulatory logic underlying genes implicated in heart diseases in individual cardiac cell types across age.

"Abstract": "Understanding region-specific responses to neurodegenerative signals in the human brain is vital for unraveling complex neurological disorders. We present a multi-modal single-cell analysis, incorporating chromatin accessibility and transcriptomes, of 200,000 brain cells from donors spanning different age groups. Our findings unveil cell-type-specific reactions and identify regulatory elements linked to genes implicated in neurodegeneration. Notably, we observe distinct cellular states and functional pathways across brain regions in response to neurodegenerative signals. This dataset provides a valuable resource for deciphering the molecular intricacies underlying brain responses to neurodegenerative challenges.",
